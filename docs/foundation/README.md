# Foundation: Planning and Architecture

This section focuses on establishing the foundational documentation and architectural decisions for the cloud platform CI/CD automation project.

## Documents

- [Scope and Ownership](./scope-and-ownership.md) - Defines project scope and team ownership
- [Supported Tooling](./supported-tooling.md) - Lists the tools and technologies used
- [Architectural Assumptions](./architectural-assumptions.md) - Documents key architectural decisions and assumptions

## Objectives

The foundation documents establish the baseline requirements, tooling decisions, and architectural principles that will guide the implementation in subsequent phases.
