# NOTES FOR GITHUB SETUP
# ==============================================================================
# To enable CODEOWNERS enforcement:
# 1. Go to repository Settings
# 2. Navigate to Branches
# 3. Edit branch protection rule for 'main'
# 4. Enable: "Require review from Code Owners"
# 5. Enable: "Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed"
#
# Team setup in GitHub:
# - Create team: platform-admins (senior platform engineers)
# - Create team: platform-team (all platform contributors)
# - Create team: app-team (application developers integrating with platform)
#
# Without these teams configured, GitHub will show warnings
# For now, replace with actual GitHub usernames if teams don't exist
